# This app reads data from PokerStars game.
### It can work on any number of tables simultaneously

PokerStars windows don't even have to be visible, but **cannot be minimalized**.
It needs admin privileges since it grabs screenshots with win32api. It's fastest way and do not require windows to be on top.

At the moment this app recons:
* Cards on table
* Player cards
* Game stage

# How to
**To make it work you need to set up orange table and default deck with 4 colors!**
* install requirements.txt
* enter Pokerstars rooms (any number)
* run powershell as admin
* python main.py

Letter "X" and "?" signs means that card wasn't recognized properly.

# Example output
```
########################
Player cards: [T9, C6]
Cards on table: [TA, H6, H4, CJ, C5]
Game state: River
Table: Gotha VI
########################
Player cards: [T2, C6]
Cards on table: []
Game state: Prefloop
Table: Aida VI
########################
Player cards: []
Cards on table: [HQ, P8, C2]
Game state: Floop
Table: Aitne VI
########################
```
Each table has separate output and it's being send to stdout on change on this table.
